        <!-- <h3 class="post-title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3> -->
          <p>To have emotional intelligence means to be able to notice and be attentive to the emotions you have – as well as the emotions of those around you! People who have developed this skill are able to identify what emotions are happening for them, what triggered them, and how those emotions, when not managed effectively, can affect others.</p>
          <p>It can be really helpful to intentionally grow in the area of emotional intelligence as it can help with building relationships, the reduction of stress (whether on your own or around others), handling conflicts that come up, and can even help with being more satisfied with your job – or knowing when it’s time to move on from it!</p>
          <br>
        <h3 class="post-title">Different Aspects of Emotional Intelligence</h3>
          <p>A person with a good degree of emotional intelligence often has some noticeable characteristics. For instance, <em><b>self-regulation</em></b>, which is the ability to manage and tend to impulses that want to come from emotions. Another, quite related, aspect that comes from having emotional intelligence is <em><b>self-awareness</b></em>. This is the ability to recognize those emotions and not let themselves be controlled by them, which helps with being able to take an honest look at themselves and see where they need to work on – a capacity that animals don’t have! Other skills include <em><b>empathy</b></em>, <em><b>motivation</b></em>, and the ability to <em><b>self-soothe</b></em>.</p>
        <br>
<h3 class="post-title">How can we develop this skill?</h3>
 <p>One effective way of developing emotional intelligence is by be attentive and actively notice how you are feeling in the moment. Journaling can help with this part of the development – writing the emotions down on paper and why they might be there is a good way of simplifying and visually untangling everything going on in your head!</p>  
 <p>Another important way to develop in the skill in making sure to take responsibility for your actions – whether good or bad! Something that hinders the ability to be present, and, therefore, the development of emotional intelligence, is having those spiralling thoughts.</p>

 <!-- <br><h3 class="post-title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3> -->
<p>With any skill, it is important to be consistent. Emotional intelligence is no different. Sticking to it and remembering to keep it in mind everyday will help it to come more naturally.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="post-title">How and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>It will be important for me to first really look for the solution myself while making sure to ask someone if I cannot find the solution in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
         
         <br>
         <h3 class="post-title">What you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
         <p>I hope to learn as much as I can and to have the opportunity to ask and discuss any questions that come up along the way.</p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="post-title">Scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
        <p>I work with a church and so Sundays are normally a very busy day for me. I prefer not to do any other kind of work on this day – unless it’s crucial and important, which I am always happy to do! I’m flexible.</p>
