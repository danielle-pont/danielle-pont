        <p>Class and ID attributes are both useful ways of defining a selector, making it possible to be a lot more specific about which parts of the website we wish to style in a certain way. In this blog post, the differences between Class and ID selectors will be covered, as well as where they can best be used and important things to remember while using them.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="post-title">Styling Specific Areas of a Website</h3>
        <p>When using HTML, we often need to use the same tag multiple times. However, styling these tags across all sections and pages of your website can make for a difficult task as, when referring to a tag in your CSS document on its own, any styles you add will apply to all content specified by the tag used. This is why it is so important to know about class and ID selectors as they allow for specification between individual or certain groups of the tags that have been used elsewhere on the website. <br><br> While both classes and IDs enable us to do similar things in terms of styling different parts of a website, the two have some differences that are important to know about before making use of them. </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="post-title">Classes</h3>
        <p>Classes are used primarily for the styling of a select number of the elements on a website. For instance, if wanting to style a single p tag a certain way, while also being aware of a large number of other p tags on the website. A class can be used in this instance as it can target the content within a single p tag without altering the content within the other p tags. The example below shows what a p tag that has had a class attribute given to it looks like:</p>
          <br>
          <h6 class="caption"><em>The below image shows the HTML document, which specifies which p tag/s are given the class.</em></h6>
          <ul class="carbon">
            <li>
              <img src="../images/carbon.png" alt="arc thumb 1">
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br><h6 class="caption"><em>The below image shows the style sheet, which is specifying that all content with a class of "blog-title" will be coloured red.</em></h6>
          <ul class="carbon">
            <li>
              <img src="../images/carbon1.png" alt="arc thumb 1">
            </li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>In the style sheet, the p tag with the class “blog-title”, which is the name of the class given to the third p tag, will be coloured red. The top two p tags, which don’t have a class given to them, will not be coloured red as they have not been given the class.</p>
          <p>Specifying the style for a class will also style all other elements, such as div, h1, and header that have also been given the same class, though it can be specified even more to only style the p tags with the class, as well. All that needs to be done is putting the name of the tag before the class period in the CSS document, shown in the image below:</p>
          <ul class="carbon">
          <li>
            <img src="../images/carbon2.png" alt="arc thumb 1">
          </li>
        </ul>


<br>
<h3 class="post-title">IDs</h3>
<p>IDs are different in that they must be unique. The name given as a certain ID cannot be used anywhere else in the website. They are the name given to a distinct area of the website – for instance, the header or footer. Below is an example of how and where an ID might be used on a website:</p>
  <br>
  <h6 class="caption"><em>The below image shows the HTML document, which shows that the ID "important" has been given to a specific div tag.</em></h6>
  <ul class="carbon">
    <li>
      <img src="../images/carbon3.png" alt="arc thumb 1">
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br><h6 class="caption"><em>The below image shows the style sheet, which is specifying that all content within the ID of "important" will have a background colour of brown.</em></h6>
  <ul class="carbon">
    <li>
      <img src="../images/carbon4.png" alt="arc thumb 1">
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>A simple way of remembering the difference between classes and IDs is by remember that class is for the <em>type</em> of item, while ID is that item's <em>distinct name</em>. For example, I am the only Danielle Pont in the 2022 Whai cohort at Dev Academy this year, the ID, but there is a group of students in the Whai cohort this year, the class.</p>
