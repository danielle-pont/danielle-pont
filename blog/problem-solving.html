          <p>
            We learnt a lot about soliving problems this week and different methods and tools that are out there. Some of these included <b><em>pseudocode</em></b>, which involves using comments to plan out what will be done in plain English, talking to a <b><em>rubber ducky</b></em>, logging to the <b><em>console</b></em>, using <b><em>Google</b></em>, and understanding how to read <b><em>error messages</b></em>. In this post, I will share about how I have used some of these tools and methods to solve some problems.
          </p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Thinking it Through</h3>
            <p>One major problem I came up against during this was when I looked at the exercise and couldn’t figure out where to even begin. This was especially an issue when it came to the <em>Find Scooby</em> challenge. Going from what was basically a blank page to a finished function that somehow was going to end with Scooby being found (?!!) was super daunting. Being stuck before I had even started meant that a number of the methods and tools at hand, such as Google and even analysing the error messages, weren’t really an option – not in the way that using pseudocode was.</p>
            <ul class="carbon">
              <li>
                <img src="../images/psdo.png" alt="arc thumb 1">
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For me, the pseudocode method really came in handy as it allowed me to stop and think about what I actually wanted to be doing, and what I wanted to have come out of that. The code shown above is what I started off with when it came to this challenge. Everything was in quotes, written in my own words, and described what was being given to me and how I wanted it to be used in order to find Scooby. It made me so much less freaked out about how many things I might-have-potentially had to maybe have needed to do. Once I had a semblance of an idea of what I needed, it was a bit easier to use the other tools, such as logging tests to the console and having a look on Google to find out about the different functions I could use.</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="post-title">Reflect and Explore</h3>
          <p>After everything was complete and the function <em>finally</em> worked, it was really helpful to reflect on the process I used – so I could use it again the next time this will, very inevitably, happen. That way, whenever I’m stressed about something that <em>looks</em> daunting, I can remember that I was able to get through a similar situation before and this was how. Though, of course, it’s not one-size fits all and so honing in on the different types of tools and methods for problem solving is something that should most definitely be done as well!</p>
