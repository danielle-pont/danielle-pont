        <h3 class="post-title">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
        <p>When I worked as a guidance counsellor, I had to learn how to deal with a number of ethical concerns. One situation I could use as an example was when I took on too many clients for a period of time. While it was great to be able to support as many people as I could, I found I was getting very drained. This was not good as I was not able to give my very best as I was spread too thin. In response to this, I decided to limit my number of client sessions to five per day. While the decision made the wait-time to see me longer, I found I was so much more engaged and organized, which made for a much greater therapeutic benefit for my clients, as well.<br></p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="post-title">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>Having been raised in a western culture, which has naturally been of influence to my personal values and identity. I very much value the pursuit of knowledge, creativity, and self-discovery. These values, paired with my own sense of identity and cultural lens, are what motivate me to make life meaningful for not only myself, but others as well. People have so much potential and it is my favorite thing to see when someone, myself included, discovers a little bit more about themselves and their uniqueness in the world.</p>
      <br>
<h3 class="post-title">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>
<p>From past conversations with supervisors and colleagues about my personal strengths, my sense of curiosity and social intelligence have often come up. I can attest to this in thinking about my desire to learn and grow as well as the way I work in a team setting. While I prefer to avoid head of department or managerial roles, these aspects of myself have allowed me to lead teams when I have needed to. I find I value collaboration as opposed to micromanagement – everyone on a team has their own unique set of experiences and, therefore, something valuable to contribute.</p>
  <p>Limitations have also come up in these conversations with those I have worked under. One example that I have been working on for a while is having confidence in what I am doing. Whenever working, especially when at a new job, I had often found myself second-guessing everything I did in fear I would do it wrong. As I gain more experience, this feeling often goes away – but not entirely. Over the past few years, I have been working on accepting mistakes are a part of life and to live more in the moment, fixing issues as they come to me while not worrying about the infinite number of problems that might come.</p>
  
  <br><h3 class="post-title">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
          <p>Curiosity, I am noticing, has been a wonderful part of myself to have during the beginning of this journey. I really enjoy discovering new things – and this line of study has an endless amount of those! I know this enjoyment in figuring out how things work will sustain me when I come across different obstacles as I will want to know the answer.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="post-title">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
          <p>When I was working for a design house a number of years ago, I had to work with a small team to prepare a shoot for the up-coming edit. Collaborating with a group of creative people brings a lot of ideas, which can be both a benefit and a hinderance. It definitely became a hinderance when some in the team really wanted a certain model for a garment, while the others wanted a different model. Because the team was very evenly split on the matter, I found it important to put my own opinion aside and instead work toward a compromise. I think compromise is one of the most crucial parts of teamwork as everyone can feel heard. While it was tricky to mediate this particular situation, which was in a highly stressful environment, I found that listening to everyone’s opinion helped everyone to not take the matter too personally and instead feel included and an important part of the team.</p>
          <p>Good mediation is definitely a teamwork strategy I will use in the future where needed as it allows for projects to move along without unresolved conflict and extreme tension – which I can imagine would be a great hinderance to workflow if ignored.</p>
