        <h3 class="post-title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I hope to work in a role that is always changing so I can come up with completely new ideas on a regular basis. Over the past few months I have been working remotely as a writer for an analytics company and have found that I really love working away from an office – so hopefully I’ll be able to score a job that’s remote.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="post-title">Describe your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        <p>I am very curious and have always loved coming up with new ideas. I think a limitation that comes along with this, though, is the constant need to move onto the next thing instead of finishing the thing I’m currently doing in a strong way. I’m working on that.</p>
      <br>
<h3 class="post-title">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>I would love to be able to extend my knowledge base with so many more things that can be done through HTML, CSS, JS and the libraries that come along with them.</p>
  
  <br><h3 class="post-title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
<p>I want to be able to stick to a schedule and complete everything I need to get done not just on time, but early.<br>
  In order to manage a heavier workload, I think scheduling needs to be a priority – as well as sticking to that schedule. However, having good communication is good also in the event that I need to share the load a bit (without just dumping it on someone else, of course!)
  </p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="post-title">How and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>It will be important for me to first really look for the solution myself while making sure to ask someone if I cannot find the solution in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
         
         <br>
         <h3 class="post-title">What you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
         <p>I hope to learn as much as I can and to have the opportunity to ask and discuss any questions that come up along the way.</p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="post-title">Scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
        <p>I work with a church and so Sundays are normally a very busy day for me. I prefer not to do any other kind of work on this day – unless it’s crucial and important, which I am always happy to do! I’m flexible.</p>
